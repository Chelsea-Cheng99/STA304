# Overview

This repo contains code and data for forecasting the US 2020 presidential election. It was created by Xi Cheng, Guangyu Du, Shichao Feng and Zhitong Liu. The purpose is to create a report that summarises the results of a multilevel logistic regression model with post-straitification that we built. Some data is unable to be shared publicly. We detail how to get that below. The sections of this repo are: inputs, outputs, scripts.

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original. We use two datasets: 

- [Survey data - detail how to get the survey data: https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/80e25a4e-f33e-428e-94c9-b599ec374f43]
- [ACS data - detail how to get the ACS data: https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/4e0770a4-89ef-403b-8480-cad62eaecd0a]

Outputs contain data that are modified from the input data, the report and supporting material.

- We decided not to share the .csv data file as well
- the final report is paper.pdf

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs and produce outputs. These are:

- 01_data_cleaning.R
- 02_data_preparation.R
